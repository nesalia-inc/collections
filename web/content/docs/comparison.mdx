# Comparison

See how `@deessejs/collections` compares to other data modeling solutions.

## Collections vs Drizzle ORM

| Feature | Drizzle ORM | Collections |
|---------|-------------|-------------|
| Type Safety | ✅ | ✅ Enhanced |
| Schema Definition | Manual | Automatic from fields |
| Validation | Zod (manual) | Built-in with field types |
| Relations | Manual | Declarative with reverse relations |
| i18n | ❌ | ✅ Native support |
| Plugins | ❌ | ✅ Built-in plugin system |
| API Generation | ❌ | ✅ Auto-generated Hono APIs |
| Hooks | ❌ | ✅ Lifecycle hooks |
| Learning Curve | Medium | Low |

**Key Difference**: Collections is a higher-level abstraction built on Drizzle ORM. You still get Drizzle's performance and query flexibility, but with a richer API for defining collections, validation, i18n, and plugins.

**Use Drizzle ORM when**: You want full control and minimal abstraction.

**Use Collections when**: You want productivity features like plugins, i18n, and auto-generated APIs on top of Drizzle.

## Collections vs Prisma

| Feature | Prisma | Collections |
|---------|--------|-------------|
| Type Safety | ✅ | ✅ |
| Schema Language | Custom `.prisma` file | TypeScript + Zod |
| Validation | Built-in | Built-in with Zod |
| Relations | ✅ | ✅ |
| i18n | ❌ | ✅ Native support |
| Plugins | ❌ | ✅ Built-in plugin system |
| Migrations | ✅ Custom | Via Drizzle Kit |
| Database Support | Many | Postgres, MySQL, SQLite (via Drizzle) |
| Performance | Good | Excellent (no query engine overhead) |

**Key Difference**: Prisma uses a custom schema language and requires a query engine. Collections uses TypeScript and Zod for schemas, giving you better IDE integration and no runtime overhead.

**Use Prisma when**: You prefer a custom schema language and don't need i18n or plugins.

**Use Collections when**: You want TypeScript-native schemas, i18n, and plugins.

## Collections vs Payload CMS

| Feature | Payload CMS | Collections |
|---------|-------------|-------------|
| Data Modeling | ✅ | ✅ |
| Admin UI | ✅ Full-featured | ❌ Not included |
| Type Safety | ✅ | ✅ |
| i18n | ✅ | ✅ Native |
| Plugins | ✅ | ✅ |
| API Generation | ✅ Express/Koa | ✅ Hono |
| Database | MongoDB/Postgres | Postgres/MySQL/SQLite |
| Framework Agnostic | ❌ Requires Node server | ✅ Works with any runtime |
| Bundle Size | Larger | Smaller (functional-first) |

**Key Difference**: Payload CMS is a full headless CMS with an admin UI. Collections is the data modeling layer only—you bring your own frontend.

**Use Payload CMS when**: You need a complete CMS with an admin UI out of the box.

**Use Collections when**: You want data modeling and API generation without the admin UI overhead, or you want to build a custom admin interface.

## Collections vs TypeORM

| Feature | TypeORM | Collections |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| Type Safety | ✅ Decorators | ✅ TypeScript |
| Schema Definition | Decorators | Functional API |
| Validation | Manual with class-validator | Built-in with Zod |
| Relations | ✅ | ✅ |
| i18n | ❌ | ✅ Native support |
| Plugins | ❌ Listeners/subscribers | ✅ Full plugin system |
| Performance | Medium | Excellent (no decorators overhead) |
| TypeScript Inference | Good | Perfect (Zod-driven) |

**Key Difference**: TypeORM uses decorators and classes. Collections uses functional composition and TypeScript objects, giving better tree-shaking and type inference.

**Use TypeORM when**: You prefer Object-Oriented patterns with decorators.

**Use Collections when**: You prefer functional composition and better type inference.

## Collections vs tRPC

| Feature | tRPC | Collections |
|---------|------|-------------|
| Type Safety | ✅ End-to-end | ✅ Data layer |
| API Definition | Procedural | Collection-based |
| Validation | Zod (manual) | Built-in with field types |
| Database Layer | You choose | Drizzle ORM |
| i18n | ❌ | ✅ Native support |
| Data Modeling | ❌ | ✅ |

**Key Difference**: tRPC is for type-safe APIs between frontend and backend. Collections is for modeling your data layer with i18n and plugins.

**Use Both Together**: Collections provides the data modeling and CRUD operations, tRPC provides the type-safe API layer. They work great together.

```ts
// Collections: Data modeling
const { collections } = defineConfig({
  database: { url: process.env.DATABASE_URL! },
  collections: [users, posts]
})

// tRPC: Type-safe API layer
export const appRouter = router({
  users: {
    list: t.procedure.query(() => collections.users.findMany()),
    create: t.procedure.input(z.object({ name: z.string() }))
      .mutation(({ input }) => collections.users.create({ data: input }))
  }
})
```

## Summary

**Choose Collections if you want:**

- Type-safe data modeling on top of Drizzle ORM
- Native internationalization support
- A powerful plugin system for extending functionality
- Auto-generated APIs
- Functional, composable APIs

**Collections sits in a sweet spot**: More productive than raw Drizzle, lighter than Payload CMS, more TypeScript-native than Prisma, and more focused than tRPC.
